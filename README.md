# hawkeye-visualization-cpp
A visualization of HawkEye technology in cricket for LBW decisions. 

This program uses graphics.h functions to visualize LBW decisions. 3D to 2D plotting is done by changing the x and y dimensions as a linear function of the value in z dimension, and the motion of the ball is goverened by parabolic motion.
